## About Me

In my current day job, I'm a violinist in the orchestra of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic for children and youth.
\
Although my profession is not related to programming, the teamwork skills, the experience of working in an international orchestra\
and the perseverance that I have gained are very useful.
I really love to study, to learn something new every day. \
That's why I decided to get a second profession.
